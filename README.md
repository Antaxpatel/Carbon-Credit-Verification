🛰️ Carbon Credit Satellite Verification
Welcome to the future of transparent environmental monitoring. This platform uses high-resolution satellite imagery and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) analysis to verify carbon offset claims with scientific precision.

🌟 Key Features
📊 Live Dashboard
Get a birds-eye view of processed data, total carbon offsets, and real-time vegetation health indices.

🔍 Satellite Verification
Submit your project coordinates to:

Analyze historical vegetation growth.
Verify plantation density.
Secure independent validation for carbon credits.
🧮 Carbon Calculator
Estimate the environmental impact of your project based on area, tree species, and local climate data.

🛠️ How to Get Started
Access the Portal: Enter your project dashboard.
Verify Claims: Use the verification tool to submit geospatial data.
Track History: Monitor all your verified projects in one place.
