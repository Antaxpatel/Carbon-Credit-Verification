# 🛰️ Carbon Credit Satellite Verification

Welcome to the future of transparent environmental monitoring. This platform uses high-resolution satellite imagery and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) analysis to verify carbon offset claims with scientific precision.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 📊 Live Dashboard
Get a birds-eye view of processed data, total carbon offsets, and real-time vegetation health indices.

### 🔍 Satellite Verification
Submit your project coordinates to:
- Analyze historical vegetation growth.
- Verify plantation density.
- Secure independent validation for carbon credits.

### 🧮 Carbon Calculator
Estimate the environmental impact of your project based on area, tree species, and local climate data.

## 🛠️ How to Get Started
1. **Access the Portal**: Enter your project dashboard.
2. **Verify Claims**: Use the verification tool to submit geospatial data.
3. **Track History**: Monitor all your verified projects in one place.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This platform is currently in **Prototype Mode**. Analysis results are simulated for demonstration purposes and should not be used for actual financial reporting yet.
